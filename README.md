## Reducing Hospital Readmissions: Data-Driven Insights from CMS HRRP


## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital readmission rates using CMS HRRP (Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program) data for FY 2025, focusing on Hartford HealthCare and national trends. The goal is to identify risk factors, financial impact, and strategies to reduce readmissions.

## Dataset Overview
##### Source: CMS HRRP Data (FY 2025) https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3
##### Period Covered: July 1, 2020 – June 30, 2023
Key Fields:
- Facility Name
- State
- Measure Name (condition)
- Excess Readmission Ratio
- Predicted Readmission Rate
- Expected Readmission Rate
- Number of Readmissions

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) –- for data extraction, transformation, analysis and visualization 
- Power BI -- for data visualization and dashboard development
- Excel/CSV -- data source format
- Microsoft Word (DOCX report generation) –- Business report on findings

## Key Analyses Performed
### Hospital Performance Analysis
- Identified hospitals with the highest & lowest readmission rates
- Examined how hospital discharges correlate with readmission risk

### Condition-Specific Trends
- Found Heart Failure (HF) has the worst readmission rate (23.06%)
- Analyzed Pneumonia & Heart Attack readmission trends
- Compared hospital performance by condition

### Geographic & Financial Impact Assessment
- Identified states where hospitals consistently exceed expected readmission rates
- Estimated financial impact of penalties for hospitals like Hartford HealthCare

### Strategic Recommendations
- AI-driven patient risk prediction – Identify high-risk cases before discharge
- 7-day post-discharge follow-ups – Reduce preventable readmissions
- Better patient education & medication adherence – Improve post-discharge care

## Project Outcomes
- Identified cost-saving strategies for hospitals to minimize penalties
- Showcased how AI-driven interventions can prevent unnecessary readmissions
- Developed visualization to communicate insights effectively
